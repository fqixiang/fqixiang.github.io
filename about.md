Hi, I'm Qixiang (pronunciation: [kisjan]).

I started my current PhD project in June, 2020 at Utrecht University under the supervision of [Dr. Daniel Oberski](https://daob.nl/) and [Dr. Dong Nguyen](https://www.dongnguyen.nl/). The focus of my PhD project is on improving measurements of and causal inferences with theoretical (latent) constructs (e.g. personalities, human values) by leveraging high-dimensional textual data.
